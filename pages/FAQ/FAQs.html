                                        <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                                            dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                                            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                                            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                                            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                                            (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                                            treatment. <br><br>Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                                            becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
                                            and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
                                            heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                                            People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                                            attention.</p>

                                        <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                                            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                                            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                                            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
                                            around the person.<br><br> Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
                                            these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                                            People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
                                            person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
                                            why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                                            person who is sick.</p>

                                        <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                                            appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                                            be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main
                                            feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                                            COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because

                                        <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                                            expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                                            from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                                            people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                                            particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                                            possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                                            a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

                                        <h3>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</h3>
                                        <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                                            there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
                                            For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                                            still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                                            areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                                            these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                                            and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                                            case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                                            restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                                            disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                                            COVID-19.
                                            COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                                            has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                                            new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                                            situation where you are or intend to go.</p>

                                            about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
                                            therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
                                            outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<br>

                                        <h3>Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19</h3>
                                        <p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
                                            to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
                                            receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
                                            be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
                                            Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
                                            investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.

                                        <p>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
                                            outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
                                            related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are
                                            quite different.
                                            SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
                                            There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since

                                            coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
                                            Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
                                            looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is

                                            transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
                                            produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
                                            protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
